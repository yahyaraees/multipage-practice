It seems there might be an issue with the way Vercel is handling the rewrites configuration, especially if it's not redirecting as expected.

To address the problem, you can try these steps:

1. Ensure the vercel.json file is correctly placed in the root directory of your project.
2. Update your vercel.json to include headers and rewrites for proper routing.
Try the following code for vercel.json:

json
Copy code
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/index.html",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Content-Type",
          "value": "text/html; charset=utf-8"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
